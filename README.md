# atm_simulation
ATM Simulator is a Python mini project that simulates basic ATM operations such as PIN verification, balance enquiry, withdrawal, and deposit. It uses loops, conditionals, and user input handling. This project helped me practice control flow, debugging, and menu-driven programs.

 Learning Summary from ATM Simulator Project

 What you have learned:

- Python Basics: variables, input(), int(), print()
- Control Flow: if, elif, else, nested conditions
- Loops: while loops, nested while, break, while–else
- Debugging: fixing indentation and logic errors
- Mini-project skills: menu-driven program, simulating real-world logic (ATM)

 What you should learn next:

- Functions (def) to organize code
- Input validation and error handling
- try-except for safe input
- Modular programming
- File handling basics
- Writing clean, commented code
- Git & GitHub usage
